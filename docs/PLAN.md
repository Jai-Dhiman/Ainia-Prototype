```

### Smart Prompting System

```python
class PromptBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_template = """
        Create a short adventure story for {child_name} (age 5-9) with theme: {theme}.
        Include exactly one {learning_type} problem naturally in the story.
        Make it safe, positive, and engaging. End with the learning challenge.
        """
    
    def build_prompt(self, theme, child_name, learning_type):
        return self.base_template.format(
            theme=theme, child_name=child_name, learning_type=learning_type
        )
```

### Learning Element Integration

```python
class LearningIntegrator:
    def embed_math_challenge(self, story, difficulty_level):
        # "The dragon found 3 golden eggs and 2 silver eggs. 
        # How many eggs did she find in total?"
        pass
    
    def embed_vocabulary_challenge(self, story, age_level):
        # "The treasure map has a mysterious word: 'ADVENTURE'. 
        # Can you tell what it means?"
        pass
```

### Safety & Parent Explanation System

```python
class SafetyValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.safety_principles = [
            "Age-appropriate for 5-9 year olds",
            "No scary or violent content",
            "Positive messaging and growth mindset",
            "Inclusive representation"
        ]
    
    def validate_and_explain(self, story, theme, learning_element):
        # Validate content safety
        is_safe = self.check_safety_principles(story)
